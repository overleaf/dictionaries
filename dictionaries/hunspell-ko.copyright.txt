           that Contributor.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
      3.1. Application of License.
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.
 .
      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
      3.3. Description of Modifications.
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
           (a) Third Party Claims.
           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
           (b) Contributor APIs.
           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
           (c) Representations.
           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
           this License.
 .
      3.5. Required Notices.
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
      to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
      Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
      rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
      terms You offer.
 .
      3.7. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
      understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
      6.1. New Versions.
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
      will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.
 .
      6.3. Derivative Works.
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
      this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
      8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
      shall survive.
 .
      8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
      You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
 .
      (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
      the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days
      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
      the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
      (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
      Participant.
 .
      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
      license.
 .
      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
      prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
      rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United

           distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or more
           trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which are not

 .
           III. Netscape and logo.
           This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks

           Code or Modifications.
 .
           IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.
           Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape
           has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code.
           To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making
           such third party code available under this License, Netscape may
           choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being
           required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if
           such code would otherwise be considered "Modifications" under
           this License.
 .
           V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.
                V.1. In General.

                Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the
                Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape
                during the two (2) years following the release date of the
                Original Code, without such additional products becoming
                subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
                additional products on different terms from those contained
                in this License.
 .
                V.3. Alternative Licensing.
                Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded
                Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without
                such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of
                this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on
                different terms from those contained in this License.
 .
           VI. Litigation.
           Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
 Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
 other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
        wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
      for the public:

      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
