## Overleaf Dictionaries

Hunspell dictionaries, converted to UTF-8 from Debian packages.

To rebuild the dictionaries, run the `build.sh` script:

```sh
build/build.sh
```

Each dictionary is licensed under the terms specified in the `hunspell-*` or `myspell-*` Debian package from which it was derived; see the relevant `*.copyright.txt` file in the `dictionaries` directory for details.
